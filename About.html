    Hi!
    I recently graduated from George Brown College
    with a diploma in Computer System Technician.Various
    projects helped me gain technical skills and an insight into the world
    of computers which touches Web Programming- HTML, CSS,
    Javascript, MySQL and Python with Cisco Networking ,
    Windows Server and Hardware .
    Along with Technical Skills from academics I gained Customer
    Service Skills with my experience in working as an Office Administrator and
    Sales Representative.It taught me how essential it is to maintain
    customer loyalty.
    With my fresh approach, experience and enthusiasm I would be happy to serve
    in your company.
